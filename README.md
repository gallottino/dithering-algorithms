# Dithering Algorithms

In computer graphics, **dithering** is an image processing operation used to create the illusion of color depth in images with a limited color palette.

## Ordered Dithering

Threshold matrix applied to each pixel based on its position.

- [ ] Threshold Matrix
- [ ] Clustered dots
- [ ] Central white point
- [ ] Balanced centered point
- [ ] Diagonal ordered matrix with balanced centered points
- [x] Bayer Matrix

## Diffuse Error

- [ ] One-dimensional error diffusion
- [ ] Two-dimensional error diffusion
- [x] Floyd-Steinberg
- [ ] J F Jarvis, C N Judice, and W H Ninke
